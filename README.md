# PyTunesDroidSync
Sync iTunes to your Android device.

**IMPORTANT NOTE** I don't know Python. I don't know source control. I don't know package management. I am essentially a single chimp at a single typewriter. If this code compiles and works: you're welcome! If not: *womp womp*. This is a personal project to help me learn Python, it is not production code.

# Borrowed Code

  * Converted to a wheel and distributed with this repo. I hope that's OK.
