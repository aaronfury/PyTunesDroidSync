# PyTunesDroidSync
Sync iTunes to your Android device.

**UPDATE 2024/01/22**
Hey guess what. The Apple Music app no longer auto-generates the "iTunes Library XML" file that this project needs. There are probably ways around this by triggering an AppleScript to manually export the library XML or to use some low-level code to read the Music library buuuuut I'm not doing that. So this project is effectively dead. Feel free to desecrate its miserable, withered husk as you see fit.

**IMPORTANT NOTE** I don't know Python. I don't know source control. I don't know package management. I am essentially a single chimp at a single typewriter. If this code compiles and works: you're welcome! If not: *womp womp*. This is a personal project to help me learn Python, it is not production code.

  * Converted to a wheel and distributed with this repo. I hope that's OK.
